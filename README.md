# Hangman Game

- Hangman is interactive word game. It was originally build with vanilla JavaScript. Then, converted into React.

- I chose Hangman game because Iâ€™m interested to learn & share solving word problems. I use modern react hooks to build the game.

### How To Play The Game - pseudocode steps:

- Matched letters ||
- Letters that do not match ||
- The word (itself) ||
- Letters that have not been guessed yet ||
- Total number of guesses before the player won or lose ||
- Current progress

- Rule - we need at least 2 players with different roles
- Two main steps in creating the game:
  - build the structure - create the static version of the app
  - add functionalities - identify what state wee need

### Challenge/Task:

- Re-create the Hangman word game with some modifications.
- The challenge was choosing the game & hover effect functionality

### Technologies used:

- React -JS library and CSS3

### Project Specifications

- Display hangman pole and figure using SVG
- Generate a random word
- Display word in UI with correct letters

### Lessons I learned:
